Commit and push the changes to your hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed repository.
Check the Deployment of the Website:

Go to the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù tab in your repository to see the workflow running.
Once the workflow is complete, the deployed website should be accessible at:
bash
Copy code
https://<GitHub username>.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed/
Make a Change to the Website and Check the Deployment:

Make a change to the website (e.g., update content/contact.md) and commit and push the change.
This should trigger the GitHub Actions workflow again, and the change should be reflected on the website.
Understanding the GitHub Actions Workflow
In the README.md file of the hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed repository, the GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying the Hugo website to GitHub Pages is detailed. The workflow, triggered by changes pushed to the main branch, consists of essential steps such as checking out the source repository, initializing the Hugo environment with a specific version, compiling static files, and publishing to GitHub Pages using the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages action. The workflow leverages the GitHub token stored in secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication, ensuring secure access for pushing changes to the repository. Notably, the "publish_branch" parameter specifies the branch (gh-pages) where the compiled website is deployed. The README captures insights from a conversation with Claude, emphasizing the nested structure of keys in YAML, the syntax for accessing secrets, and the use of [bot] in user credentials to denote automated accounts. By incorporating these details, the README provides a comprehensive overview of the automated deployment process, enhancing understanding for repository visitors and collaborators.
